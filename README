=============== UML DIFFERENCES ==============
==============================================

As we can see from the pdf images of after_uml and before_uml, the design
has changed a lot in the course of the work done for this exercise.
Indeed, due to the creation of new objects in the game we have decided to
create new packages and separate them differently.
For example,for the Noise class, we thought to put it in the same package as terrain and block
but at the end we thought it was fairer to put it in the util package with also the class of NumericLife,
it also creates later in the game.
We can also notice that the leaves class does not exist in the before_uml.
This is because we thought we would create several leaves in the Tree class itself.
but at the end we figured out that it was more advantageous and clearer to create a separate class.
In conclusion, we have noticed a big change in the construction of our code and its design,
following the evolution of the game and of course, the complexity of the code as you go through the steps.


==============================================
=============== INFINITE WORLD ===============
==============================================

In the update function of PepseGameManager we check the position of our avatar
if it has moved forward by 10 blocks then we create a world that extends 10 blocks forward
(including trees, monsters and all other kinds of objects that belong to the game)
depending on the direction in which it is heading.
In the same way, we also remove all the elements that belong to the world of our game over a distance
of 10 blocks, located at the end of the screen and opposite to the direction in which the avatar is heading.
This way it allows us not to keep too many elements in the game in order to prevent the game from bugging.


==============================================
============ TREE'S CONSTRUCTION  ============
==============================================

We choose to create four classes for the creation of a tree.
The first one it’s the class tree that regroup each element of the tree.
The second one it’s the trunk that correspond to the creation of block with a random height.
The third one that consist to decide where and how many  leaves we want to create  for each tree,
and the last one the class leaf that create a single leaf.
We create those  class for the different types of collision each one can do but also
We define  our classes depending on what characterize a tree, his trunk, the num of leaves and also the leaf itself.


==============================================
============ DECISION OF DESIGN   ============
==============================================

we had a few dilemma on our design how we wanted to construct our classes.
First for tree we didn't know how many classes we will do maybe just three, the second for leaf and the third for the
truck but at the end in order to have clear code we decide to create a fourth.In our bonus we create monster and flags
and at the beginning we wanted to create them in PepseGameManager but we had problem of collision with truck so
we decide to create them in the class tree.In fact we create monster and the flag  only if there isn't tree at this
position.


==============================================
==================  BONUS   ==================
==============================================

We have decided to make a bonus in order to make the game more attractive and more complex.
We added 3 things:
1- lives, our avatar has 3 lives at the start of the game, when he has lost these 3 lives the game will be over
So we created a counter that counts down to 0 if this counter is equal to 0 then the game is over.
These lives are also displayed on the screen to inform the player of the number of lives under
their belt at any time during the game.
2- monsters: their role is to make our avatar lose lives if he touches them he will lose a life.
These monsters can also move left or right and are not static.
We created our monsters in a new class and in avatar we added that if there is a collision with
the monster then one life will be counted and the avatar will be removed from the game.
3- an end flag: if our avatar touches the flag, and of course he still has lives to his credit,
then he will have won the game.
We have created a new class which creates our flag based on the position and direction of our avatar.
We also added in this class that if there is a collision with the avatar then this avatar will have won.
In either case, whether he wons or losts, the player may decide to play again or to quit the game.
